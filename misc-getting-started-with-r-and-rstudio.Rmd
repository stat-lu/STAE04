## Installing R and R Studio

### R

Installing R is easy. Simply go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/> and download the appropriate version of R depending on your operating system:

Linux
: Click on *Download R for Linux*, pick a link based on your distribution 
  (such as `ubuntu/`), and then follow the instructions specific to that 
  distribution.
 
Windows
: Click on *Download R for Windows*, then *base*, and finally 
  *Download R X.X.X for Windows*.
    
Mac (OS) X
: Click on *Download R for (Mac) OS X*, then under "Latest release" 
  click on *R-X.X.X.pkg*.

### R Studio

After you're done installing R, it's time to install R Studio. Simply go to
<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> and pick a 
suitable version for R Studio depending on your operating system. Download 
and install it.

## Getting Started with R Studio

To proceed, open R Studio and do the following:

1. Create a project (`File -> New Project`), name it `dataviz`, `stae04`, 
   (or whatever you feel like), and save it to a folder somewhere on your 
   hard drive. This will be where you store all your work on the course.
2. Create a `data` folder in that project.
3. Create an R script (`Ctrl/CMD + Shift + N`) and save it inside your 
   project folder. (If you are moving through the course material in order, 
   you may want to name it `worked_example_r.R` or something along those lines.)
4. Play around with R by writing some commands in the **Console**. Try out 
   some basic commands like `3 + 1` and `mean(c(1, 3, 5))`.
5. Put some code into your R Script, such as the commands above, and try 
   executing the code by highlighting the code and hitting `Ctrl/CMD + Enter`.

### Settings

There are a lot of settings in R Studio. Most of the defaults are fine, but 
there is at least one setting we recommend that you alter straight away. Go 
to `Tools -> Global Options` and un-check 
*"Restore .RData into workspace at startup"* and select *"never"* for
*"Save workspace to .Rdata on exit"*.
