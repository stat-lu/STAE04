# Spring 2021

### Changes

- Several new *Worked Examples* have been added to the course. The source
  code for all of these worked examples has also been made available on the
  GitHub repository for the course.
- All of the reading assignments have been converted into
  quizzes.
- The initial "Post a Visualization" assignment has been removed.
- The workshops have been made weekly (instead of bi-weekly), and
  the duration has been shortened to one hour.
- Prerequisites and requirements for the course modules have been removed so
  that all the course content is now accessible right away.

# Fall 2020

### Feedback

Feedback on the course was positive across all items in the course evaluation.
We received one specific request, which was to make the workshops (help 
sessions) weekly instead of bi-weekly.
