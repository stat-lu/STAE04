```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,

To reason about visualizations we need to know a little bit about the anatomy of 
a plot and in this text we'll talk about some of the fundamental parts of a plot
so that you know the lingo that we'll be using extensively throughout this 
course.

To get going, we first need a plot to focus on. We'll use a simple plot of
horsepower versus fuel consumption from the `mtcars` dataset.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy.png")
```

To produce the plot, simply run the following code.

```{r anatomy, fig.cap = "Horsepower and fuel consumtion in miles per gallon for a set of motor cars in the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Horsepower",
       y = "Fuel Consumption (miles per US gallon)",
       color = "Cylinders")
```

## The Canvas 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-canvas.png")
```

The canvas, also called the plot area, is the area on which the data is drawn. 
Everything outside of the canvas will be annotations and usually don't display
data directly.

If you use facets in your plot, you might have several canvasses
in a visualization. We'll discuss facets in detail later, but for now it's
sufficient that you think of facets as multiple plots that you line up one after
the other.

## Grid

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-grid.png")
```

Sometimes, as in the default ggplot2 theme, the canvas is divided into sections
by a grid. A grid often makes it easier to compare data points, especially when
they are far apart. Grids are particularly useful when there are few 
observations in a visualization.

Grids often have major and minor gridlines, which is also true for this plot,
although the difference is slight.

## Geoms

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-geoms.png")
```

The geoms in the plot are geometrical shapes that are used to draw data. Here we
are using points as our geoms.

## Axes

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-axes.png")
```

The axes is a guide for the connection between the coordinates of the geoms
and the variables they are mapped to. Without the axes, we would only see the 
pattern of points and not the values these points represent.

On each axis there are numbers or words and they are connected via *ticks* or
*tickmarks* to the gridlines.

## Legends

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-legend.png")
```

A legend is a guide that helps you read an aesthetic mapped to a variable
in the plot. The legend in this plot links a color scale to the number of 
cylinders.

The legend is sometimes also called a *key*.

## Titles

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-titles.png")
```

The axes should almost always have titles. Titles should be informative and
if it is not otherwise clear from the caption (see below), they should also
indicate the unit of measurement if it is not obvious from context. In this 
plot, for instance, the unit for fuel consumption is given in parenthesis. 
Sometimes a slash is used instead.

How to format the titles varies depending on the publication. Title or sentence
case are the two most common choices, but lower case can be fine too.

title case
:   A Nice Title of Something Important

sentence case
:   A nice title of something important

lower case
:   a nice title of something important

A title should not end with a period unless it is a full sentence.

If it not immediately clear from the categories of the legend, the legend
should also have a title. Some people like to use a main title (and even 
subtitle) for the visualization as well (using `ggtitle()` or 
`labs(title = "some title")`), but this is usually not necessary and even
frowned upon in some formal contexts.

## Caption

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-caption.png")
```

When including a visualization in a report, it should always have a numbered 
caption. The caption should make the entire visualization self-explanatory.
Details should be provided in the main body of the text, but given the caption 
and the visualization, any reader should be able to interpret the plot. 

Note that the captions will be numbered automatically if you use R Markdown; 
most WYSIWYG editors (such as Microsoft Word) are also able to number figures.
