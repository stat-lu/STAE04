# Arthrithis

In this worked example we will be working with data from a treatment trial
for Arthritis. The data comes from the 
[vcd package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd). To begin, let's
load the package and take a `glimpse()` at the data.

```{r}
# install.packages("vcd") # if you haven't installed it yet
library(vcd)
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(Arthritis)
```

Notice that `Improved` is helpfully formatted as an ordinal (ordered)
variable already, which is going to help ggplot to choose the correct
color palettes for us.

# Bar Charts

Let's start with a simple bar chart to see how many people were allocated
to the two treatment arms.

```{r, fig.cap = "Treatment allocation for the arthritis study.", fig.width = 2.2, fig.height = 2.2}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(Arthritis, aes(Treatment)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Was the Treatment Effective?

Now for something more interesting. Let's try to look at how well the treatment
seems to have worked. We start with a stacked bar chart.

```{r, fig.cap = "Treatment effect in the arthritis study.", fig.height = 3}
ggplot(Arthritis, aes(Treatment, fill = Improved)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(fill = "Improvement") # add a better legend title
```

It's immediately clear that the treatment has worked well! The count of people
with a improvement is much higher in the treatment arm compared with the placebo
arm. But how do the treatments compare when it comes to people who've made
*some* improvement? This is difficult to say from our approach here. This
is due to two reasons:

1. The stacked bar chart makes it very hard to compare all but the
   first category, since the other portions of the bars are not aligned.^[This
   is not quite as severe a problem for this particular visualization since the
   inner grouping variable is ordinal. For other problems, however, this can
   be detrimental to the result.]
2. The bars are not proportional.^[To be fair, the differences between the group
   sizes are small here, but this also means that we don't lose any information
   when using proportional bars instead.]

Let's try a grouped, proportional bar chart instead. To do this, we need
to do a little more work since there is no direct option to do this
in ggplot2. Our two choices are:

1. use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to compute the proportions we need
   directly, and then plot the bar chart with `geom_col()` or
2. use `after_stat()`.

We will try the second option here. We start with the code.

```{r, fig.cap = "Grouped, proportional bar chart of the arthritis data.", fig.height = 3}
Arthritis %>%
  ggplot(aes(Treatment, group = Improved, fill = Improved)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(prop)), position = "dodge") +
  labs(fill = "Improvement",
       y = "Proportion")
```

So how does this work? The key to this is that `geom_bar()` computes (and
makes accessible) certain statistics. Among these are `prop`, which is
the *groupwise* proportion. To access this statistic, we need to use the
special `after_stat()` function, which acts as a wrapper that evaluates
its arguments after the statistics in the enclosing function have been
computed. To get this to work properly, we also need to map the `group`
aesthetic, so that ggplot knows which category to compute proportions within.

This strategy can be used with many other layer functions (`geom_*()` functions)
in ggplot.

# Mosaic Plots

In the lecture we also encountered mosaic plots, which are proportional
bar charts that map, not only the height of the bars, but also the
width of the bars to group sizes.

In the lecture, we used the 
[productplots](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=productplots) package, but
here we will try another solution offered by
[ggmosaic](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggmosaic).

```{r}
# install.packages("ggmosaic") # if don't already have the package

library(ggmosaic)
```

Unlike **productplots**, **ggmosaic** works directly with a ggplot2 object,
adding auxiliary functions (`geom_*()` functions) to extend its functionality.

```{r}
ggplot(Arthritis) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Treatment), fill = Improved))
```

The key features to notice about this call are

1. that the `aes()` specification must reside *inside* the call to 
   `geom_mosaic()`, and not in the `ggplot()` function and
2. the call to `product()`, which acts simply as a list of variables that
   you want to use in the mosaic plot.
   
The main benefit of the mosaic plot is that we get to see more of the data.
With the bar charts we needed to separate visualizations to provide
information on the overall size of the groups (treatment arms), whereas
with the mosaic plot we can make do with only a single plot.^[But note that
it is the *relative* size that we show. If we want the actual *counts* in
the outer category, we still need to add additional plots or provide
this information in text.]

# Waffle Plots

Waffle plots are easy-to-read visualizations that are actually quite uncommon
in statistical visualizations but much more prevalent in media outlets such as 
newspapers. They are, as we mentioned in the lecture, at their best when some of
the categories are so small that their sizes are hard to estimate in a
barchart of mosaic plot.

There is a great package for mosaic plots that interact well with 
ggplot2 called [waffle](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=waffle).
Unfortunately, the current version of CRAN is outdated^[Feel free to
voice your support for a CRAN update
at <https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle/issues/72>.]
and much of the new functionality that makes it work well with ggplot i only
available from the 
[development version at GitHub](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle).

For that reason, waffle plots are not compulsory material in this course and
will serve mostly as a bonus for those who are interested. 

To download development versions of R packages from GitHub, you need either
the [remotes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes) package.^[
[devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) is enough too, since it
simply interfaces directly with functions in **remotes**.]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install remotes
install.packages("remotes")

# install waffle
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/waffle")
```

The waffle package requires that our data contains counts of the 
categories, so before we can use it, we need to do a bit of wrangling. More
precisely, you need to group the data by `Improved` and `Treatment` and
then use `summarize()` together with either the `n()` function to get either
counts or proportions. We'll settle for counts in this example. Before looking
at the following code, see if you can do this by yourself. The result should
be a 6-row tibble with columns `Treatment`, `Improved` and `Count` (or
whatever you want to call it). Save the result to an object called
`Arthritis_summarized`.

```{r}
Arthritis_summarized <-
  Arthritis %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Improved) %>%
  summarize(Count = n())
```

Now we're ready to start making waffles! The aesthetics you need to know
about here are `fill` and `values`. Values is what we want to map the
counts or proportions that we just created to and `fill` will connect
our inner-most group to fill color. We start with the simplest
possible waffle chart, just looking at improvement among the
participants in the treatment arm.

```{r, fig.cap = "A basic waffle chart of the results from the treatment arm."}
library(waffle)

filter(Arthritis_summarized, Treatment == "Treated") %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = Improved, values = Count)) +
  geom_waffle() +
  labs(fill = "Improvement")
```

This looks like a waffle chart, but there's a lot of superfluous information
that we'd rather get rid off. Thankfully, **waffle** provides the 
helpful `theme_enhance_waffle()` function for this. Moreover we probably
prefer the symbols (rectangles) to be squares rather than rectangles, which
we can accomplish by forcing the coordinate system to be isometric using
`coord_equal()`. Finally, it will look more aesthetically pleasing if we
swap the black line color for white, increase their width slightly, and
change theme to the minimal variant.

```{r, fig.cap = "A prettier waffle plot."}
filter(Arthritis_summarized, Treatment == "Treated") %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = Improved, values = Count)) +
  geom_waffle(color = "white", size = 1.5) + 
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme_enhance_waffle() +
  labs(fill = "Improvement")
```

That looks much better, doesn't it?

To wrap up, we now look to the full data set by including both
treatment arms. To do this with **waffle**, you need to use facets. Here we do
so via the `facet_wrap()` function, simple providing the outer category
that we want to facet on.

```{r, fig.cap = "Improvement after treatment for arthritis in placebo and intervention arms.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(Arthritis_summarized, aes(fill = Improved, values = Count)) +
  geom_waffle(color = "white", size = 1.5, n_rows = 5) +
  facet_wrap("Treatment") +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme_enhance_waffle() +
  labs(fill = "Improvement")
```

# Euler Diagrams

Euler diagrams are used to visualize relationships between sets. Most of
you have probably encountered Venn diagrams during in your first
statistics courses. Euler diagrams are like Venn diagrams but don't have the
requirement that we need to visualize intersections that are empty. Euler
diagrams are only really useful when you have overlap among categories, such
that observations can belong to any, all, or none of the levels of a category.

Here we'll use the [eulerr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eulerr) package.
This package creates *proportional* Euler diagrams, trying to make the
area of each intersection proportional to that intersection's size. This is
not always possible, in which case `euler()` will return a approximate fit.
For this reason, it is important to always first *fit* the diagram, inspect
the fit, and then finally plot it.

The simplest way to run `euler()` is to provide a named numeric vector
that indicates intersections and their sizes. Here's a very simple example.

```{r}
# install.packages("eulerr")
library(eulerr)

fit <- euler(c("A" = 5, "B" = 2, "A&B" = 1))
```

Notice the use of the ampersand (`&`) to separate intersections here. Let's 
examine the fit of the Euler diagram.

```{r}
fit
```

Stress and diagError are both 0, so the fit is perfect! This will in fact
always be the case for two-set combinations. No we can safely plot the result.
Simply call `plot()` on `fit` to do so.

```{r, fig.cap = "A simple Euler diagram.", fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
plot(fit)
```

`euler()` can also work directly with data, provided that the columns are 
factors, characters, or logicals. The arthritis data that we've dealt with
so far, however, does not lend itself well to an Euler diagram. Can you
think of why?

The reason is that most of our categories are exclusive. A person cannot be
both in the treatment arm and in the placebo arm, or for that matter
have made both no improvement and a marked improvement, so it is not
suitable for this kind of visualization.

Instead, we'll take a look at a dataset from the **eulerr** package
called `organisms`. It contains features from a list of organisms:

```{r}
organisms
```

Each value indicates for a given organism, such as a cat, whether it is
an animal (yes), a mammal (yes), plant (no), and so on. We can simply
call `euler()` on this data set directly.

```{r}
(fit_organisms <- euler(organisms)) # parantheses makes R print the object
```

This doesn't look great, unfortunately. The `stress` and `diagError`
are large^[We won't delve into what these actually mean here, but please read 
the documentation for the package if you are interested.] and if we
take a look at a diagnostic plot, we'll see that many of the areas in the
plot are misrepresented.

```{r, fig.cap = "A diagonstic plot of the fit on the organisms data."}
error_plot(fit_organisms)
```

One alternative we can try is to use *ellipses* instead of circles. We
specify this in the call to `euler()`, like so:

```{r}
(fit_organisms_ellipses <- euler(organisms, shape = "ellipse"))
```

The stress metric has improved significantly, but not the diagError measure.
Looking at the error plot, it seems like the errors are smaller than before.

```{r}
error_plot(fit_organisms_ellipses)
```

At this point, we need to think hard about whether we can tolerate this 
type of error or not---notice that there, for instance, still is overlap between
the plant and mammal categories. If not, we should look for another type of 
visualization altogether, but if yes, then we are now ready to plot the final 
result.

```{r, fig.cap = "Relationships between various categorizations of organisms."}
# quantities = TRUE shows the number of actual observations in each
# intersection
plot(fit_organisms_ellipses, quantities = TRUE)
```
